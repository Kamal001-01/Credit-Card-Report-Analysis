This project involves analyzing credit card transaction data using SQL Server for data processing and Power BI for visualization and reporting. The objective is to extract insights into credit card spending patterns, transaction trends, and user behavior.

Project Overview
Credit card transactions are a crucial part of understanding consumer spending habits. This project aims to analyze these transactions to uncover trends and provide useful insights for stakeholders.

Key Objectives:
Identify spending patterns across different categories.
Analyze transaction volumes and frequency over time.
Understand customer behavior and transaction preferences.
Tools Used
SQL Server: For data processing, transformation, and querying of credit card transaction data.
Power BI: For data visualization and reporting, allowing for interactive dashboards and insights into transaction data.
Dataset
The project uses a synthetic or real dataset (replace as appropriate) of credit card transactions, which includes columns such as:

transaction_id: Unique identifier for each transaction
user_id: Unique identifier for each user
transaction_date: Date of the transaction
amount: Amount of the transaction
merchant_category: Category of the merchant where the transaction occurred
location: Location of the transaction
payment_method: Type of payment method used (e.g., credit, debit)
Analysis Steps
Data Import and Cleaning: Using SQL Server to import and clean data, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
Data Transformation: Applying transformations to structure the data for analysis, including handling missing values, categorizing transactions, and aggregating data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Running queries to gain initial insights into spending patterns, popular transaction categories, and location-based analysis.
Advanced Analysis:
Identifying high-value transactions and frequent users.
Analyzing trends over time, such as monthly or seasonal changes in transaction volume.
Visualization in Power BI: Creating interactive dashboards to illustrate:
Transaction trends over time.
Breakdown of spending by category and location.
Customer transaction frequency and spending habits.
Key Insights
This analysis provides insights into:

Weekly spending trends.
Top merchant categories by transaction volume.
Geographic distribution of transactions.
Average spending by user and category.
